i have noticed important improvement that we need to address in our project,

NOTE: i want us to move our approach of generating chunks, metadata, heading_context, document_section,topics, keywords,audience, question_type. to using our llm (gemini) and each of these schema types should have there own embeddings

1, the content data type should be the only data type that will be stored with the original markdown format, cause i noticed that the content i not stored as a markdown,
