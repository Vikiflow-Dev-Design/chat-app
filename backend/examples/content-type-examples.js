  content: `# Employee Performance Review Process

## Overview
Our annual performance review process ensures fair evaluation and career development for all employees.

## Preparation Phase
Managers and employees prepare for the review meeting through self-assessment and goal review.

### Employee Self-Assessment
Employees complete a comprehensive self-evaluation covering:
- Goal achievement from the previous year
- Key accomplishments and challenges
- Skills development and training needs
- Career aspirations and growth areas

### Manager Preparation
Managers gather feedback and prepare evaluation materials:
- 360-degree feedback from colleagues
- Performance metrics and KPI analysis
- Documentation of achievements and areas for improvement
- Career development recommendations

## Review Meeting
The formal review meeting follows a structured agenda.

### Meeting Structure
| Phase | Duration | Focus Area |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Opening | 10 min | Relationship building |
| Self-Assessment Review | 20 min | Employee perspective |
| Manager Feedback | 20 min | Performance evaluation |
| Goal Setting | 15 min | Future objectives |
| Development Planning | 15 min | Career growth |

## Post-Review Actions
Following the review meeting, both parties complete follow-up activities.

### Documentation Requirements
- Completed performance review form
- Goal setting worksheet for next year
- Professional development plan
- Salary adjustment recommendations (if applicable)

## Timeline and Deadlines
The review process follows a strict timeline to ensure completion across all departments.`,

// Example 3: Medical/Healthcare Document
const healthcareExample = {
  content: `# Patient Medication Management Protocol

## Purpose
This protocol ensures safe and effective medication administration in our healthcare facility.

## Patient Assessment
Every patient requires thorough assessment before medication administration.

### Initial Medication Review
Conduct comprehensive medication reconciliation:
- Current medications and dosages
- Known allergies and adverse reactions
- Previous medication effectiveness
- Potential drug interactions

### Contraindication Screening
Check for contraindications before administration:
- Patient allergies and sensitivities
- Current medical conditions
- Concurrent medications
- Age and weight considerations

## Administration Procedures
Follow the "Five Rights" of medication administration.

### The Five Rights
| Right | Verification Required |
|-------|---------------------|
| Patient | Two patient identifiers |
| Medication | Compare to order |
| Dose | Calculate and verify |
| Route | Confirm administration method |
| Time | Check timing requirements |

### Documentation Requirements
Document all medication administration:
- Time and date of administration
- Medication name and dosage
- Route of administration
- Patient response and any adverse effects
- Healthcare provider signature

## Adverse Event Management
Respond immediately to medication-related adverse events.

### Recognition and Response
Signs requiring immediate intervention:
- Allergic reactions (rash, difficulty breathing)
- Severe side effects
- Medication errors
- Patient refusal or inability to take medication`,
