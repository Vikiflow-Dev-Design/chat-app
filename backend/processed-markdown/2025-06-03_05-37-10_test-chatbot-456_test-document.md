# Advanced RAG System Guide

## Introduction

This document explains the Advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

## What is RAG?

RAG combines retrieval and generation to provide accurate, contextual responses.

## Key Components

1.  Document Processing
2.  Chunking Strategy
3.  Vector Storage
4.  Similarity Search
5.  Answer Generation

## Benefits

*   Improved accuracy
*   Real-time information
*   Contextual responses
*   Scalable knowledge base

## Implementation Steps

1.  Process documents using Docling or fallback methods.
2.  Create intelligent chunks with relationships.
3.  Store chunks in a vector database.
4.  Implement hybrid search for optimal retrieval.

## Conclusion

Advanced RAG provides a robust solution for knowledge-based AI systems.
