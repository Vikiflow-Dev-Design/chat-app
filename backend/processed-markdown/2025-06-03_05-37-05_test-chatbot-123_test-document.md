# Advanced RAG System Guide

## Introduction

This document explains the Advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

## Understanding RAG

### What is RAG?
RAG combines retrieval and generation to provide accurate, contextual responses.

### Key Components
1.  **Document Processing:** Initial step to prepare raw data.
2.  **Chunking Strategy:** Breaking down documents into manageable, meaningful pieces.
3.  **Vector Storage:** Storing document chunks as numerical vectors.
4.  **Similarity Search:** Finding relevant chunks based on query similarity.
5.  **Answer Generation:** Using retrieved chunks to generate a coherent response.

### Benefits
*   Improved accuracy
*   Real-time information
*   Contextual responses
*   Scalable knowledge base

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Process Documents:** First, process documents using Docling or fallback methods.
2.  **Create Intelligent Chunks:** Second, create intelligent chunks with relationships.
3.  **Store Chunks:** Third, store chunks in a vector database.
4.  **Implement Hybrid Search:** Finally, implement hybrid search for optimal retrieval.

## Conclusion

Advanced RAG provides a robust solution for knowledge-based AI systems.
